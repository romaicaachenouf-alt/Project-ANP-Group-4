## 1_About Diabetes: What is Diabetes?Diabetes is a chronic disease where the body has too much glucose (sugar) in the blood because it either doesn't produce enough insulin or can't effectively use the insulin it produces. Insulin, a hormone made by the pancreas, helps move glucose from the blood into cells for energy. High blood glucose over time can lead to serious health issues affecting the nerves, eyes, and kidneys. 

   
## 2_About Diabetes:Types of diabetes
Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM): The body’s immune system attacks the insulin-producing cells in the pancreas, leading to little or no insulin production. 

Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM): The body still produces insulin, but the cells don’t respond to it properly (insulin resistance), and over time the pancreas may not make enough insulin. 

Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM): This develops during pregnancy in someone who didn’t have diabetes before, and it usually disappears after delivery. 

Other specific types of diabetes: These are less common and include forms such as monogenic diabetes (e.g., MODY), neonatal diabetes, diabetes caused by diseases of the pancreas, genetic defects, etc.
